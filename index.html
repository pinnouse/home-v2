I&#x27;m Nicholas, but you can call me <b>Nick</b>. I&#x27;m a passionate developer with a drive to realize great solutions. I have an <b>Honours Bachelor of Science (HBSc) in Computer Science and Mathematics</b> from the University of Toronto. And I am interested in deep learning with transformers as well as accessible and beautiful software for both users and developers.<br/><br/>As a developer, I have professional experience in automation software and web development.<br/><br/>Outside of studies, I play guitar, piano, and alto saxophone. I enjoy listening to all types of music, but especially jpop and classical. I am also trying to learn a few languages: Japanese, and Korean, whilst brushing up on my Cantonese. Apart from a bunch of hobbies, I like to stay educated on maintaining a <b>good physique</b> and <b>mental health</b>.</p><h2 class="Home_subtitle__KzT68">Large Projects</h2><p class="Home_description__uXNdx">A list of projects that I have been a part of, that I think best showcase my skillset and passion!</p><div class="Portfolio_grid__Y8GQY"><div class="Portfolio_card__fLiQM"><div class="Portfolio_image__DuTSK"><img src="/portfolio/chat.gif" alt="AI Chatbot" width="1280" height="720"/></div><div class="Portfolio_info__Awgx5"><h3>AI Chatbot</h3><h4>Open domain AI powered conversational chatbot</h4><p>Ongoing learning and building of an open domain AI chatbot.
